**************************** CUSTOM HOOKS IN REACT ****************************


* useDebounce Hook

The useDebounce custom hook is a powerful tool for managing real-time interactions in React applications. It delays the execution of a function or state update until a specified time period has passed without any further changes to the input value. This is particularly useful in scenarios such as handling user input or triggering network requests, where it effectively reduces unnecessary computations and ensures that resource-intensive operations are only performed after a pause in the input activity.
